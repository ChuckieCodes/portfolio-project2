      <div  class="about-text" id="about-jump"> <span class="highlight">As</span> a tech sales professional with 10 years of experience, I excel in building strong client relationships and driving revenue growth. I am thrilled to transition into a full-stack engineer role where I can apply my passion for technology and problem-solving skills to create innovative solutions. I have developed programming skills in HTML and CSS through self-study and hands-on coding projects. I thrive in fast-paced environments, collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams, and continuously challenge myself to learn and grow. Let's connect to discuss how my sales experience and emerging technical skills can drive digital transformation and deliver high-quality software solutions.

During my time at Revel Systems, I had the opportunity to become a project manager for large enterprise clients. I was tasked with selling technologies like APIs and XML code reconfiguration, despite having little prior knowledge about them. However, I embraced the challenge and achieved great success. This experience has fueled my curiosity about the diverse world of coding, and it ultimately led me to take the plunge into becoming a full-stack engineer.

Combining my sales experience with my emerging technical skills, I aspire to leverage my background in building client relationships and driving revenue growth to contribute to the digital transformation of organizations. I am eager to apply my expertise in software development, alongside my passion for technology and problem-solving, to create innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of customers.
