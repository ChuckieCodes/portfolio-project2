# Advanced CSS: Portfolio


## Description 

I have created an advanced CSS portfolio to showcase my previous work to potential employers and collaborators. The portfolio includes my name, a recent photo or avatar, and sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. It has a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The navigation links allow users to easily access specific sections, such as my work samples. Clicking on an application image takes the user to the deployed application. This portfolio serves as an example of my development skills and can be used to assess my suitability for job opportunities or collaborations.
